1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
It provide developers with the ability to build large scale applications effectively. This is best examplified by reuseable components.

1. Describe component state.

State is a value linked to the virtual dom that allows us to update.  We use components to display some data (often called “state”) to the screen for our users.

1. Describe props.

Props are key values pairs tied to components. When we want to pass information held on state inside one component to another component, we pass them as props.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects look for changes in the dom and execute a function or a command when they see a change. We can sync our side effects with state and prop changes.
