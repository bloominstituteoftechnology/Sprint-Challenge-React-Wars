1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? React is a library for JavaScript. What it does is provide us with a virtual DOM to work with rather than having to use the regular DOM. Doing this prevents boiler plate code as well as makes worry less about DOM performance. This is due to re-rendering the page every time state changes.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react? It means to make your app in components, making state evolve over time in the simpliest way possible. By doing you can quickly and efficiently build wonderful apps.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component. Class components are a way to hold/handle state. They are stateful components and they can do the same as a functional component but as stated hold and manipulate state. Functional components are stateless and can present the information from state/class components however cannot actually manipulate it.

4.  Describe state. State is object data, it determines how a component renders/behaves. Which you can use to make your applications interactive.

5.  Describe props. Components can be customized with special parameters these parameters are called props. You use these props to add to functional/class components to as stated customize them.
